export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I’m a dedicated Full Stack Web Developer with a strong foundation in building dynamic, responsive, and user-centric web applications. 
My tech stack includes React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, which I use to craft both intuitive frontends and robust backends.

Through a hands-on full stack development internship, I gained practical experience in real-world project development and collaborative workflows. Additionally, winning a coding hackathon boosted my ability to solve problems under pressure and think creatively in high-stakes environments.

Driven by curiosity and continuous learning, I strive to write clean, efficient code and build web experiences that are both functional and visually engaging.`;
